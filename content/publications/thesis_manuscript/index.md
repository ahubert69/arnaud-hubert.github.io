publication: Endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity and its implication in fast learning
publication_short: nothing
abstract: Neurons are essential components of the brain. By transmitting electrical signals, they give rise to all our intellectual functions when organized into complex networks. These neurons communicate through connections called synapses, which can adjust their efficiency — a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity. This plasticity plays a key role in learning, but its mechanisms vary depending on the type of experience (emotional, repeated, or single). This thesis aims to better understand the biological mechanisms that allow the brain to learn from a single experience — so-called fast learning. Two approaches are presented. The first uses computational modeling to predict what happens at synapses during fast learning; the second explores, from a theoretical perspective, how neurons behave when organized into large networks.},
