bio: "PhD candidate in the AistroSight team-project at the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology.

  My research focuses on synaptic plasticity, especially in the cortico-striatal projection diring the context of fast learning.

  I work with electrophysiological data from neuropixel, and implement mathematical models of synpases to simulate realistic synaptic plasticity under realistic conditions.

  My interest also includes theoretical approaches, such as incorporating heterogeneous synaptic coupling, and plasticity in mean-field models. "
